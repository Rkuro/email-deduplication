# email-deduplication

This script de-duplicates a csv file of emails using an inputted primary column. It outputs a new file called `new-file.csv` with the de-duplicated emails.

Currently runs on python2.7 so that Macs can run it out of the box.


## Usage:

```python
python main.py <your-csv-file.csv>
```
